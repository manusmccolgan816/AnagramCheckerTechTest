Assumptions:
    The program should repeatedly ask for input until told to stop.
    The username should be written to the file, as well as the two values and an indicator of whether they are anagramas.
    The file will not be manually altered.

Unit tests are present in the test folder.

The program also validates that inputs do not have special characters.

Entries in the file are not unique (I didn't have time to implement this), although entries in the cache are unique as it is a HashMap.

The cache is populated with previous results from the file.
